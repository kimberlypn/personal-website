      If you have known me for a while (or have talked to me some time around
      March or April), you will know that I love going to&nbsp;
      <a href="http://east.paxsite.com/">PAX East</a>. Specifically, it is the&nbsp;
      <a href="https://www.penny-arcade.com/pinny-arcade/">Pinny Arcade</a>
      &nbsp;that keeps me coming back every year. I am a sucker for collecting
      things and an even bigger sucker for organizingâ€” and that is exactly why
      this project came about.<br /><br />
      I wanted to make a website where I could keep track of the dozens of pins
      that I have collected over the years, monitor the market price of each
      pin, and record all of the trades that took place during the convention.<br /><br />
      This website is still in the making since I was overwhelmed with final
      assignments not too long after starting it. Some things that I would like
      to do are to scrape the Pinny Arcade website for the pin images instead
      of hardcoding them and to use an API to get the market prices of each pin.
