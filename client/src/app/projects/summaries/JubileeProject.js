      This was a website that I collaborated on for the&nbsp;
      <a href='http://www.learntoquestion.com/seevak/#competition'>Seevak Website Competition</a>. The purpose of this
      competition is to design a website that champions an individual or group that has made a positive impact on
      society. I enjoyed my&nbsp;
      <a href='http://www.learntoquestion.com/seevak/groups/2011/sites/power-up-gambia/'>first year</a> participating so
      much that I decided to enter again the following year. My teammates and I dedicated our website to&nbsp;
      <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJjSDX-jUChzOEyok9XYRJQ'>The Jubilee Project</a>, a group of three
      friends that make videos to raise awareness about different issues around the world. Their motto is, "Doing Good
      is
      Contagious," and we felt that this was a mission worth celebrating.<br/><br/>
      
      This time around, I wanted to take a more minimalistic route while also showcasing my growth since last year's
      competition. We accomplished this by upgrading the quality of our graphics and being more keen with our CSS
      choices. We also created a separate introductory page that made visitors feel as though they were watching a
      video from the lens of a camera, since videography is The Jubilee Project's main outlet. The video we chose was
      one that The Jubilee Project had created to honor moms around the world, which we felt was a meaningful example of
      the impact of its work.<br/><br/>
      
      Although we only won honorable mention this time, I believe I gained something even more valuable because my love
      for this competition lit the flame that later manifested into my passion for CS.
