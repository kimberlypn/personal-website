    This was a website that I collaborated on for the <a href='http://www.learntoquestion.com/seevak/#competition'>
    Seevak Website Competition</a>. The purpose of this competition was to design a website that champions an individual
    or group that has made a positive impact on society. This was my first year participating in the competition, and my
    teammates and I dedicated our website to <a href='http://powerupgambia.org/'>Power Up Gambia</a>, a nonprofit
    organization that focuses on providing solar energy to health care facilities in The Gambia, a country located in
    West Africa.<br/><br/>
    
    We wanted a website that was simple and easy to navigate yet informative. For our design, we wanted to go along with
    the theme of solar energy, so we chose light colors such as grey, white, and sky blue. We created a custom banner
    that had a sun and designed a background that had solar panels.<br/><br/>
    
    Neither my teammates nor I went into this competition with any web development experience, so we were incredibly
    happy when we ended up winning second place!
