    This was a website that I collaborated on for the <a href='http://www.learntoquestion.com/seevak/#competition'>
    Seevak Website Competition</a>. The purpose of this competition was to design a website that champions an
    individual or group that has made a positive impact on society. I enjoyed my&nbsp;
    <a href='http://www.learntoquestion.com/seevak/groups/2011/sites/power-up-gambia/'>first year</a> participating so
    much that I decided to enter again the following year. My teammates and I dedicated our website to&nbsp;
    <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJjSDX-jUChzOEyok9XYRJQ'>The Jubilee Project</a>, a group of three friends
    who make videos to raise awareness about different issues around the world. Their motto is, "Doing Good is
    Contagious," and we felt that this was a mission worth celebrating.<br/><br/>
    
    This time around, I wanted to take a more minimalistic route while also showcasing my growth since last year's
    competition. We accomplished this by upgrading the quality of our graphics and being more keen with our CSS choices.
    We also created a separate introductory page that made visitors feel as if they were watching a video from the
    lens of a camera, since videography is The Jubilee Project's main outlet. The video we chose was one that The
    Jubilee Project had created to honor moms around the world, which we felt was a meaningful example of the impact of
    their work.<br/><br/>
    
    Although we only won honorable mention this time, I believe I gained something even more valuable because my love
    for this competition lit the flame that later mainfested into my passion for CS.
